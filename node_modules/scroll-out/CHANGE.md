## [2.0.0] - 2018-06-25
### Added

- added "scrollingElement" option to target specific non-window scroll containers

- add css vars for percent visible to elements (--visible-x, --visible-y)

- onChange, onHidden, onShown are deferred until animation frame directly after setting all attributes/css vars
- The update and index method are now throttled as well
